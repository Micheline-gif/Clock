It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.

2. It can change while you are designing and writing the code. How it changes is when you add, remove or change something. 
3. It can change while the program is running. How it changes is when you create new objects, remove an object, etc.

6. Whenever you click on increment() on minutes, check it if the values rolled back to 0, if it did click on increment() on hours.

11. Error: '.class' expected / What is incorrect about this call is that java already knows that 5 is int, theres no need to add it. 
12. Using "<" keeps the maximum value one less then the limit and using "<=" lets the limit itself become a value. 
13. Using ">=0" it makes it 0-9 and using ">0" makes it 1-9. 
14. && forces positive numbers only and || accepts most of any numbers which counts negatives numbers also. 
15. True: !false, (34 != 33) && !false
16. (a && b) is true only if both are true and (!a && !b) is true only if both are false. 
18. It only works for 2 digits number, putting the limit to 1000 wont always be 2 digits.
19. They both do the same thing, the only difference is the order of "" and value.
